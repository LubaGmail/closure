# Closure

## Definition
to closure = to preserve

A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variables.  

The closure has three scope chains:
    it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets
    it has access to the outer function’s variables
    it has access to the global variables
